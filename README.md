# GRNSEQ
Open source MIDI sequencer based on p5.js, WebMidi, and jQuery

Simplest quickstart: download this repo and load /index.html using the file:/// feature in your browser. Install a simple MIDI synth such as https://notahat.com/simplesynth/ to hear the MIDI notes. On a Mac you can set up an IAC Driver Bus to connect GRNSEQ with the MIDI synth.
